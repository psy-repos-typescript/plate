Choose the approach that best matches your requirements.\n\n## Client-Side Integration\n\n### Option 1: With Plate UI (Recommended)\n\nLeverage [Plate UI](/docs/plate-ui) for a rich, pre-configured editor experience, especially if you're using or plan to use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).\n\n<Steps>\n\n#### Install Plate UI\n\nBegin by following the **[Plate UI Installation Guide](./installation/plate-ui)**. This guide covers installing core dependencies and setting up Plate UI components.\n\n#### Basic Usage\n\nOnce Plate UI is set up, choose the guide that matches your React application type:\n\n*   **[Next.js](./installation/next)** - For server-side rendered applications\n*   **[React](./installation/react)** - For client-side applications (Vite, React Router, etc.)\n\n</Steps>\n\n### Option 2: Manual Setup\n\nFor projects not using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, or those requiring a framework-agnostic solution, follow the **[Manual Installation Guide](./installation/manual)** for detailed instructions.\n\n<Callout type=\"note\">\n  You can always integrate Plate UI components into a manual setup later.\n</Callout>\n\n## Server-Side Integration\n\n### React Server Components\n\nFor leveraging Plate in React Server Components (RSC) for tasks like static content generation or server-side data processing without client-side interactivity.\n\nFollow the **[RSC Guide](./installation/rsc)** for detailed instructions.\n\n### Node.js Environment\n\nFor using Plate in a Node.js environment for backend tasks such as data processing, content migration, or validation.\n\nFollow the **[Node.js Guide](./installation/node)** for detailed instructions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter setting up Plate, explore these resources to further customize and enhance your editor:\n\n-   **Configuration:**\n    -   [Editor Configuration](/docs/editor)\n    -   [Plugin Configuration](/docs/plugin)\n    -   [Plugin Components](/docs/plugin-components)\n-   **Support & Community:**\n    -   [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/troubleshooting)\n    -   Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/mAZRuBzGM3)\n    -   Participate in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/udecode/plate/discussions)\n",
